## Mode Definitions

Understanding the distinction between these two modes is essential for reading the tables below.

### Hybrid mode (operational + consultation)

The operational LLM routes the session, runs tools, and frames the synthesis output. A separate **local consultation model** (`gemma4-consult` via a local Ollama endpoint) runs before synthesis and enriches each portfolio symbol with a structured analyst summary. The operational model receives compact enriched records, not raw data.

- Requires a local GPU host running Ollama with `gemma4-consult` (or a compatible model)
- Produces HMAC-fingerprinted synthesis records with `verbatim_required=true` and `is_heuristic=false`
- Enables the anti-fabrication controls: fingerprint chain, verbatim attribution, quote artifact
- **The local enrichment layer, not the operational model, is the primary driver of information density**

### Single-model mode (operational only, no consultation)

The operational LLM handles all routing, tool calls, and synthesis directly from heuristic analyst summaries. No local enrichment step. No fingerprint controls.

- Works with any capable cloud operational LLM
- No GPU or local inference required
- Lower information density on portfolios with many individual equities
- Still enforces guardrails and educational-only output

## Benchmark Scores — Harness V6.1.2

The harness runs 39 workflow checkpoints across 5 phases (W0–W8): holdings, analysis, performance, bonds, synthesis, lookup, export, guardrail validation. Scores below are measured on W6 synthesis output — the highest-value single response in a typical InvestorClaw session.

### Key finding

**The combined config (xai/grok-4-1-fast + gemma4-consult enrichment) produces 14× more metric citations than the heuristic baseline.** This gap is driven by the enrichment layer, not the operational model. Switching to a more expensive frontier model without enrichment produces at most modest phrasing improvement. Switching from heuristic to enriched mode produces the step-change.

### Model all-stars

Rankings across synthesis quality, speed, guardrail adherence, and zero hallucinations (QC8=0). All PASS-verdict models scored zero fabricated portfolio facts.

#### Hybrid mode (consultation + operational LLM)

| Rank | Configuration | QC4 | QC5 | Notes |
|------|--------------|:---:|:---:|-------|
| 🥇 | `xai/grok-4-1-fast` + `gemma4-consult` | **113** | **1,184** | Canonical best. Data-table dense synthesis, HMAC chain, is_heuristic=false. WF39. |
| 🥈 | `together/moonshotai/Kimi-K2.5` + `gemma4-consult` | 18 | 350 | Hybrid confirmed (215 SVG cards, fingerprints). Narrative style. WF71. |

> Grok's 6× higher QC4 in hybrid mode reflects its strength at citing enriched data in structured tables. Both models confirm the consultation layer correctly; the operational model drives how that data is expressed.

#### Single-model (cloud-only, no consultation)

| Rank | Model | QC3 | QC4 | QC5 | Speed | Run |
|------|-------|:---:|:---:|:---:|:-----:|-----|
| 🥇 | `together/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3.1` | 16 | 35+ | 400 | Together AI | WF68 |
| 🥈 | `together/moonshotai/Kimi-K2.5` | 13 | 40+ | 250 | Together AI | WF66 |
| 🥉 | `groq/moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct-0905` | ~6 | ~20 | ~350 | ~800 tok/s | WF58 ⚠️ preview |
| | `groq/openai/gpt-oss-120b` | ~3 | ~10 | ~280 | ~500 tok/s | WF46 |
| | `groq/openai/gpt-oss-20b` | ~2 | ~8 | ~250 | ~1000 tok/s | WF59 |
| | `together/zai-org/GLM-5` | 3 | 26 | 130 | Together AI | WF70 |
| | `together/MiniMaxAI/MiniMax-M2.7` | 1 | 14 | 150 | Together AI | WF69 |
| | `google/gemini-3.1-pro-preview` | 4 | 17 | 104 | Google | WF65 |
| ⚠️ last | `xai/grok-4-1-fast` (cloud-only) | 0 | **6** | ~50 | xAI | WF72 — **not recommended cloud-only** |

**Speed category winner**: `groq/openai/gpt-oss-20b` (~1000 tok/s, $0.075/$0.30/M, production-stable)  
**Value category winner**: `together/MiniMaxAI/MiniMax-M2.7` ($0.30/$1.20/M, 197K ctx)  
**Synthesis quality winner**: `together/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3.1` (400-word prose, 16 tickers named)  
**Not recommended cloud-only**: `xai/grok-4-1-fast` — lowest synthesis density of all tested models (QC4=6, QC5≈50 words). Optimized as an organizer of enriched consultation data; produces minimal output without it. Use in hybrid mode only.

#### Guardrail compliance

All PASS models: **QC8=0** across W1–W8. Notable failure: `groq/qwen/qwen3-32b` (WF67, DEGRADED) — W7 generated explicit put option and trailing-stop recommendations without educational framing. Avoid for production use.

### Information density scores (W6 synthesis output)

Scores from runs where local consultation state was confirmed for the recorded mode.

| Metric | Combined WF39 | GPT-OSS-120B WF46 | grok-4-1-fast WF72 |
|--------|:-------------:|:-----------------:|:------------------:|
| **QC3** Ticker mentions | **8** | ~3 | 0 |
| **QC4** Metric citations | **113** | ~10 | **6** |
| **QC5** Word count | **1,184** | ~280 | ~50 |
| **QC8** `is_heuristic=false` | **✅** | ✗ | ✗ |
| **QC10** Disclaimer instances | **2** | 2 | 2 |
| **QC13** Autonomous W6 prose | **✅** | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Mode** | Hybrid | Single | Single |
| **All commands pass** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

**WF39** = `xai/grok-4-1-fast-reasoning` + `gemma4-consult` (canonical combined configuration, intentional hybrid)  
**WF46** = `groq/openai/gpt-oss-120b` (clean clone, no workspace `.env`, confirmed single-model)  
**WF72** = `xai/grok-4-1-fast` cloud-only (CONSULTATION_ENABLED=false, ENDPOINT=localhost:0) — measured 19× lower QC4 vs hybrid WF39

Additional single-model runs (WF58–WF62) confirmed protocol compliance and tool-call stability for their respective models but were not scored against all 14 QC dimensions in the benchmark table above.

Phase 5 clean runs (WF63–WF71, IC-RUN-20260413-010) produced the following W6 synthesis density comparison:

| Model | QC3 | QC4 | QC5 | Mode | Result |
|-------|:---:|:---:|:---:|:----:|:------:|
| DeepSeek-V3.1 (WF68) | 16 | 35+ | 400 | Single | ✅ PASS |
| Kimi-K2.5 (WF66) | 13 | 40+ | 250 | Single | ✅ PASS |
| Kimi-K2.5 (WF71) | 17 | 18 | 350 | Hybrid | ✅ PASS |
| GLM-5 (WF70) | 3 | 26 | 130 | Single | ✅ PASS |
| MiniMax-M2.7 (WF69) | 1 | 14 | 150 | Single | ✅ PASS |
| Gemini-3.1-pro (WF65) | 4 | 17 | 104 | Single | ✅ PASS |
| qwen3-32b (WF67) | 6 | 10 | 60 | Single | ⚠️ DEGRADED |
| grok-4-1-fast (WF72) | 0 | 6 | ~50 | Single | ✅ PASS — lowest density; hybrid only |

**Note on WF71 hybrid QC4**: Kimi-K2.5 in hybrid mode produced narrative synthesis (QC4=18) lower than its single-model run (QC4=40+). The enrichment layer shifted output style toward narrative prose drawing on consultation summaries rather than restating raw metrics in tables. Compare to WF39 (grok-4-1-fast-reasoning hybrid, QC4=113) — the operational model choice strongly influences how consultation data is expressed in synthesis.

### Partial / not viable (tool calls work but impractical)

| Run | Model | Reason |
|-----|-------|--------|
| WF47 | `together/Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B-Thinking-2507` | PARTIAL/TIMEOUT — tool calls execute correctly; 5–10 min/step; full harness ~2–3 hrs; not viable for interactive sessions |

### Degraded

| Run | Model | Reason |
|-----|-------|--------|
| WF53 | `together/MiniMaxAI/MiniMax-M2.5` | `/portfolio synthesize` not recognized; W5 news non-functional — use M2.7 instead |
| WF64 | `xai/grok-4.20-0309-non-reasoning` | W4+W5 standalone tool payloads rejected ("LLM request failed: provider rejected request schema or tool payload"); W6 synthesize workaround succeeds by running analyst+news inline |
| WF67 | `groq/qwen/qwen3-32b` | `/portfolio update-identity` not recognized; W6 thin synthesis (~60 words) with file pointer; W7 offered specific put option/trailing-stop recommendations without educational framing (guardrail issue); preview model |

### Blocked (cannot execute tool calls at all)

| Run | Model | Reason |
|-----|-------|--------|
| WF49 | `together/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528` | Tool-text incompatibility — outputs tool name as code block, not a function call |
| WF50 | `together/meta-llama/Llama-4-Maverick-17B-128E-Instruct-FP8` | Tool payload rejected by Together AI serverless endpoint |
| WF51 | `together/meta-llama/Llama-4-Scout-17B-16E-Instruct` | Tool payload rejected (Groq variant runs but is degraded) |

### Groq

Fast inference (500–1000 tok/s) at low cost. 128K context limits to small-to-medium portfolios — not suitable for large multi-account or fully-enriched sessions.

| Model | Context | Benchmark | Notes |
|-------|---------|:---------:|-------|
| `groq/openai/gpt-oss-120b` | 128K | ✅ WF46 | **Recommended Groq option.** Full autonomous synthesis; $0.15/$0.60/M; 500 tok/s. Production-stable. |
| `groq/openai/gpt-oss-20b` | 128K | ✅ WF59 | Full synthesize (~250 words); $0.075/$0.30/M; 1000 tok/s. Production-stable. |
| `groq/moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct-0905` | 262K | ✅ WF58 ⚠️ | Best Groq prose (~350 words). **Preview tier — not production-stable; may be discontinued without notice.** |
| `groq/qwen/qwen3-32b` | 128K | ⚠️ WF67 DEGRADED | `/portfolio update-identity` not recognized; W6 thin synthesis (~60 words) with file pointer; W7 offered specific investment recommendations without educational framing (guardrail issue). Preview model. |
| `groq/meta-llama/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct` | 128K | ⚠️ DEGRADED | Requires extra prompt step for W6 prose; heat_level type error; preview model. |
| `groq/moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct` | 128K | ⚠️ DEGRADED | Thin synthesis (~144 words); undocumented endpoint. |
| `groq/llama-3.3-70b-versatile` | 128K | 🚫 DO NOT USE | Config corruption risk — wrote unauthorized keys into `openclaw.json` during testing. |

> **Groq stability note**: Production-stable models confirmed in official Groq docs: `llama-3.1-8b-instant`, `openai/gpt-oss-120b`, `openai/gpt-oss-20b`. Preview/beta models (`qwen3-32b`, `llama-4-scout`, `kimi-k2-instruct-0905`) can be discontinued without notice.

## Together AI Tool-Call Compatibility

Not all Together AI serverless models support OpenAI function-calling schema. InvestorClaw requires tool execution — models that reject tool payloads cannot complete the workflow.

| Works (tool-call compatible) | Blocked (rejects tool payload) | Incompatible (text output only) |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| DeepSeek-V3.1 | Llama-4-Maverick FP8 | DeepSeek-R1-0528 (tool name as code block) |
| MiniMax-M2.5 / M2.7 | Llama-4-Scout | — |
| GLM-5 | GLM-4.7 | — |
| Kimi-K2.5 | Qwen3-Next-80B | — |
| Qwen3-235B-Instruct-tput | Kimi-K2-Thinking | — |
| Qwen3-235B-Thinking* | — | — |

*Qwen3-235B-Thinking makes tool calls correctly but takes 5–10 min per response step — not viable for interactive harness runs.

## Anti-Fabrication Properties (Hybrid Mode Only)

The tier-3 enrichment path adds audit controls that no single-model configuration provides:

- **HMAC fingerprint chain** — each enriched record gets a 16-character hex fingerprint; the session accumulates a chained fingerprint across all enriched symbols for post-hoc verification
- **`verbatim_required=true` + attribution** — enriched analyst quotes carry a verbatim flag and source attribution; the synthesis layer is constrained to cite rather than paraphrase
- **`is_heuristic=false`** — signals that synthesis was produced from enriched model inference, not keyword matching
- **`synthesis_instruction`** — machine-readable citation directive injected into the compact analyst payload; tells the operational LLM to cite synthesis verbatim with fingerprint included

These controls are absent in all single-model configurations regardless of model capability.

## Consultation Model Catalog (Local Ollama)

Tested on the inference host (RTX 4500 Ada 24 GB VRAM, Ollama 0.20.3).

| Model | tok/s | VRAM | Notes |
|-------|------:|-----:|-------|
| `gemma4-consult` | ~65 | 9.6 GB | **Recommended** — tuned gemma4:e4b; optimized for consultative Q&A (num_ctx=2048, num_predict=600) |
| `gemma4:e4b` | ~66 | 9.6 GB | Base model; good quality/speed tradeoff; 128K context |
| `gemma4:e2b` | ~99 | 7.2 GB | Fastest; suitable for lighter tasks |
| `nemotron-3-nano:30b-a3b-q4_K_M` | ~25 | 24 GB | High-quality fallback; requires full VRAM |
| `qwen2.5:14b-instruct-q4_K_M` | ~45 | 9.0 GB | Code and structured output |

Create `gemma4-consult`:
```bash
ollama create gemma4-consult -f docs/gemma4-consult.Modelfile
```

Run `/portfolio ollama-setup` to auto-detect available models on your endpoint.

## Reproducibility

The full test harness is at `investorclaw_harness_v612.txt` in the repository root.

```bash
# Prerequisites
# - OpenClaw gateway running with investorclaw plugin loaded
# - (Optional) local Ollama host at INVESTORCLAW_CONSULTATION_ENDPOINT
# - Portfolio CSVs in INVESTOR_CLAW_PORTFOLIO_DIR
# - .env copied to workspace: cp ~/Projects/InvestorClaw/.env ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/investorclaw/.env

# Covers 39 workflow checkpoints across 5 phases (W0–W8)
```

### Critical: consultation is controlled by the project .env, not the workspace .env

InvestorClaw loads from the registered plugin path (`~/Projects/InvestorClaw/dist/index.js`, origin: "config"), not from the OpenClaw workspace skill directory. This means:

- **`~/Projects/InvestorClaw/.env`** is the authoritative consultation config — changes here take effect after gateway restart.
- **`~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/investorclaw/.env`** affects only the background enricher subprocess when it does NOT inherit the parent process environment. Setting `INVESTORCLAW_CONSULTATION_ENABLED=false` in the workspace `.env` has **no effect** on the plugin loaded from the project directory.

To disable consultation for a clean single-model benchmark run:
```bash
# Edit ~/Projects/InvestorClaw/.env
INVESTORCLAW_CONSULTATION_ENABLED=false
INVESTORCLAW_CONSULTATION_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:0   # unreachable — belt-and-suspenders

# Restart gateway to pick up the change
openclaw gateway stop && openclaw gateway start
```

This finding (DEV-003, discovered IC-RUN-20260413-010) invalidated the 9 earlier Phase 5 benchmark runs (WF36–WF41, WF48, WF53–WF55) that had attempted to disable consultation via workspace `.env` modifications. All 9 were re-run cleanly in WF63–WF71.
