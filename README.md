Portfolio analysis and market intelligence skill for OpenClaw. **v1.0.0** | FINOS CDM 5.x | MIT License

> **Naming note**: the package id is `investorclaw`. The OpenClaw invocation command is `/portfolio`.

---

## TL;DR

InvestorClaw is an OpenClaw skill with two modes:

1. **Personal portfolio analysis** — reads broker CSV exports, runs holdings/performance/bond pipelines, and answers follow-up questions in a persistent session.
2. **Market data tool** — queries live prices, analyst ratings, news, and yield-curve analytics for arbitrary tickers, without portfolio files.

Both modes enforce educational-only output via always-on guardrails.

- Fetches live quotes (Finnhub → Massive → Alpha Vantage → yfinance), analyst consensus, news, and optional local LLM synthesis (tier-3 enrichment).
- Does **not** execute trades, replace a broker portal, or give investment advice.
- No API keys required to start — falls back to `yfinance` automatically.
- Time to first report: ~5 minutes from `git clone` on an existing OpenClaw install.

## Quick Install

> **ClawHub marketplace listing is in progress.** Until then, install from GitHub.

### Ask your agent

> Install InvestorClaw from https://github.com/perlowja/InvestorClaw.git

The agent will clone, register, install Python deps, and restart the gateway.

### Manual

```bash
git clone https://github.com/perlowja/InvestorClaw.git ~/Projects/InvestorClaw
pip install -r ~/Projects/InvestorClaw/requirements.txt
openclaw plugins install --link ~/Projects/InvestorClaw
cp ~/Projects/InvestorClaw/.env.example ~/Projects/InvestorClaw/.env
# Edit .env — add FINNHUB_KEY at minimum
python3 ~/Projects/InvestorClaw/investorclaw.py setup
openclaw gateway restart
```

```bash
# Verify
openclaw plugins inspect investorclaw
python3 ~/Projects/InvestorClaw/tests_smoke.py
```

> **Important after every fresh clone**: copy your `.env` to the workspace:
> ```bash
> cp ~/Projects/InvestorClaw/.env ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/investorclaw/.env
> ```
> Without this, the background enricher process (detached subprocess) will not pick up your API keys or consultation endpoint config.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
python3 investorclaw.py setup         # first-time portfolio file discovery
python3 investorclaw.py holdings      # holdings snapshot with live prices
python3 investorclaw.py performance   # performance analysis
python3 investorclaw.py bonds         # bond analytics (YTM, duration, FRED benchmarks)
python3 investorclaw.py help          # show all commands
```

Always invoke via the entry point — never call command scripts directly.

## Model All-Stars

Best performers across synthesis quality, speed, guardrail compliance, and zero hallucinations (QC8=0 across all passing runs). Full benchmark data: [MODELS.md](MODELS.md).

### Hybrid (consultation + operational LLM)

| Rank | Configuration | QC3 | QC4 | QC5 | Notes |
|------|--------------|:---:|:---:|:---:|-------|
| 🥇 | `xai/grok-4-1-fast` + `gemma4-consult` | 8 | 113 | 1,184 words | **Canonical best.** 19× metric density vs cloud-only. HMAC chain, is_heuristic=false. WF39. |
| 🥈 | `together/moonshotai/Kimi-K2.5` + `gemma4-consult` | 24 | 82 | 579 words | Re-benchmarked WF84: 4.6× over prior run. Full account breakdown, bond analytics, news. |

### Single-model (cloud-only, IC-RUN-20260414-003)

| Rank | Model | QC3 | QC4 | QC5 | Notes |
|------|-------|:---:|:---:|:---:|-------|
| 🥇 | `together/MiniMaxAI/MiniMax-M2.7` | 27 | **108** | 541 words | **Top single-model overall.** Full account tables, analyst, bond detail. $0.30/$1.20/M. WF82. |
| 🥈 | `together/zai-org/GLM-5` | 20 | 74 | 481 words | Rich account breakdown. $1.00/$3.20/M. WF83. |

| 🚫 | `xai/grok-4.20-0309-non-reasoning` (cloud-only) | — | — | — | FAIL: tool payload rejection. **Hybrid-only** (WF74 PASS in hybrid). WF86. |
| ⚠️ last | `xai/grok-4-1-fast` (cloud-only, pre-injection) | 0 | 6 | ~50 words | Pre-injection baseline. WF72. |

### Guardrails & hallucination score

All passing models scored **QC8=0** (zero fabricated portfolio facts across W1–W8). The notable exception is `groq/qwen/qwen3-32b` (DEGRADED, WF67) — W7 generated specific put option and trailing-stop recommendations without educational framing, violating the educational-only guardrail.

---

## Config Profiles

### Profile 1 — Hybrid (recommended)

**Operational LLM**: `xai/grok-4-1-fast`  
**Consultation model**: `gemma4-consult` via local Ollama (~10 GB VRAM)

Designed for portfolios with individual equities. The local consultation model enriches per-symbol analyst records before synthesis runs — the harness measured **14× more metric citations** vs cloud-only baseline. Adds HMAC fingerprint chain and verbatim attribution controls.

OpenClaw config:
```json
{ "agents": { "defaults": { "model": { "primary": "xai/grok-4-1-fast" } } } }
```

`.env`:
```bash
INVESTORCLAW_CONSULTATION_ENABLED=true
INVESTORCLAW_CONSULTATION_MODEL=gemma4-consult
INVESTORCLAW_CONSULTATION_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:11434
```

> `xai/grok-4-1-fast` requires `/portfolio update-identity` at the start of each session for full guardrail disclaimer compliance.

---

### Profile 2 — Cloud-only

**Operational LLM**: `xai/grok-4-1-fast` (or any frontier model for specific sessions)

Best for ETF-heavy portfolios where per-holding analyst enrichment adds little value. Cloud-only synthesis quality for allocation, bond analytics, and sector breakdown is good. For complex portfolios with many individual equity positions, synthesis will be shallower — see [MODELS.md](MODELS.md) for measured density scores.

OpenClaw config:
```json
{ "agents": { "defaults": { "model": { "primary": "xai/grok-4-1-fast" } } } }
```

No `.env` consultation keys needed. Recommended models by priority (IC-RUN-20260414-003):
```bash
openclaw models set together/MiniMaxAI/MiniMax-M2.7       # #1 single-model — QC4=108, QC5=541 ($0.30/$1.20/M)
openclaw models set together/zai-org/GLM-5                # #2 — QC4=74, QC5=481
openclaw models set together/moonshotai/Kimi-K2.5         # #3 — QC4=55, QC5=256
openclaw models set groq/openai/gpt-oss-120b              # production-stable Groq (128K ctx, note: low QC4=17)
```

> `xai/grok-4.20-0309-non-reasoning` was re-tested (WF74) and **upgraded to PASS** — WF64's W4/W5 tool rejection was a transient model-version issue. Full W0–W8 now passes cleanly. Narrative prose style (QC3=14 tickers, QC5≈200 words). Good alternative to grok-4-1-fast when longer narrative synthesis is preferred.

---

### Profile 3 — Budget / fast (Groq)

**Operational LLM**: `groq/openai/gpt-oss-120b` or `groq/openai/gpt-oss-20b`

500–1000 tok/s. 128K context limits to small-medium portfolios. Best for quick single-session queries where cost or speed matters. Not suitable for large fully-enriched sessions.

```json
{ "agents": { "defaults": { "model": { "primary": "groq/openai/gpt-oss-120b" } } } }
```

---

## Consultation Artifact Format

Control what artifact is written per enriched symbol via `INVESTORCLAW_CARD_FORMAT` (default `both`):

| Value | Artifact | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| `json` | `~/.investorclaw/quotes/{SYMBOL}.quote.json` | HMAC fingerprint, synthesis text, attribution. Mobile-safe; no `INVESTOR_CLAW_REPORTS_DIR` needed. Safe for WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram. |
| `svg` | `{REPORTS_DIR}/.raw/consultation_cards/{SYMBOL}.svg` | Visual card with fingerprint badge. Requires `INVESTOR_CLAW_REPORTS_DIR`. |
| `both` | Both of the above | Default for desktop/web sessions. |

The `json` artifact is always machine-readable and persists independently of the SVG renderer.

| **Alpha Vantage** | ✅ sequential | ✅ adjusted EOD | ❌ | ✅ earnings proxy | 25 req/day |
| **NewsAPI** | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | 100 req/day |

**Quick config options:**

```bash
# Zero-cost start
INVESTORCLAW_PRICE_PROVIDER=yfinance

# Free with keys (better reliability)
INVESTORCLAW_PRICE_PROVIDER=auto
INVESTORCLAW_FALLBACK_CHAIN=finnhub,alpha_vantage,yfinance
FINNHUB_KEY=...   ALPHA_VANTAGE_KEY=...   NEWSAPI_KEY=...

# Recommended for regular use
INVESTORCLAW_PRICE_PROVIDER=massive
MASSIVE_API_KEY=...   FINNHUB_KEY=...
```

---

## Local Consultation Setup (Optional, Strongly Recommended)

The consultation layer enriches per-symbol analyst data locally before the cloud operational model sees the result. This is the primary driver of information density — not model capability.

```bash
# .env
INVESTORCLAW_CONSULTATION_ENABLED=true
INVESTORCLAW_CONSULTATION_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:11434
INVESTORCLAW_CONSULTATION_MODEL=gemma4-consult
```

Create the tuned model:
```bash
ollama create gemma4-consult -f docs/gemma4-consult.Modelfile
```

**Hardware**: ~10 GB VRAM (RTX 3080 class or better, CUDA 8.0+, or Mac 16 GB unified memory). Ollama >= 0.20.x.

Run `/portfolio ollama-setup` to auto-detect available models on your endpoint.

---

## EOD Report

The `eod` command generates an HTML email report summarizing your portfolio at end-of-day.

```bash
python3 investorclaw.py eod --via-gog --email-to you@gmail.com   # Google CLI
python3 investorclaw.py eod --email-to you@example.com            # SMTP
python3 investorclaw.py eod --no-email                            # file only
```

Install scheduled delivery:
```bash
python3 eod_scheduler.py --install
```

## Privacy and Security

- **PII scrubbing**: credit card numbers, SSNs, and account IDs are redacted from CSV columns on load
- **Prompt injection defense**: portfolio text columns are scanned before passing to any LLM
- **Math verification**: all financial calculations are deterministic Python — the LLM never does portfolio math
- **Data locality**: raw CSV data is never sent to external APIs; only computed summaries reach the cloud operational model
- **Guardrails**: `data/guardrails.yaml` enforces educational-only output, blocks suitability assessments

With consultation enabled, structured synthesis runs locally first. The cloud model sees only compact downstream artifacts and quoted consultative output.

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- OpenClaw >= 2026.4.x
- Optional API keys (all have free tiers): Finnhub, Alpha Vantage, Massive, NewsAPI, FRED
- Without keys: falls back to `yfinance`

## Design Intent

InvestorClaw is a reference design for a **data-intensive, stateful agentic skill**. It demonstrates compact agent-facing outputs with raw artifact preservation, deterministic downstream processing, optional local consultative LLMs, financial guardrails, and multi-step setup and report-generation flows.

The enrichment layer (`internal/tier3_enrichment.py`) is the primary driver of synthesis quality — not the operational model. Switching from heuristic to enriched mode produces a 10–15× step-change in information density. Switching operational models has modest effect by comparison.

---

## Compliance

**NOT INVESTMENT ADVICE.** InvestorClaw provides educational portfolio analysis only. It is not a substitute for professional financial advice and does not assess personal risk tolerance, goals, or investment suitability.
